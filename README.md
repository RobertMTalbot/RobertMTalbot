# Hey- I'm Bud!
_(Just like the cheap beer)_

## My job
I'm an associate professor of science education in the School of Education and Human Development at the University of Colorado Denver. I teach undergraduate pre-service science teachers, masters students (most of whom are practicing k-12 science teachers), and doctoral students. My research focuses on peer learning and teaching in undergraduate science courses, especially those htat have adopted the Learning Assistant (LA) Model. I am specifically interested in physics teaching and learning, but work across disciplines.

In the summer, I work in Wildland Fire communications. I am a COMT, INCM, RADO, and FFT2 on one of the Rocky Mountain Region Complex Incident Management Teams (IMT) and I also work on our local Boulder County (Colorado) Type 3 IMT. When I work in these capacties, I am a part-time employee of the Boulder County Sheriff's Office. 

## My hobbies
I'm an amateur radio operator (US call: W0RMT; former Australian call: VK3BUD) mostly interested in digital communications in the V/UHF parts of the spectrum. I operate D-STAR, DMR, YSF, NXDN, and P25. I build, maintain, and operate the [Colorado Digital Multiprotocol System](https://coloradodigital.net).

## My projects
Most of my limited stuff on GitHub is focused on digital amateur radio projects like hotspots, [pi-star by Andy Taylor MW0MWZ](https://github.com/AndyTaylorTweet/Pi-Star_DV_Dash), [MMDVM reflector lists managed by Jonathan Naylor G4KLX](https://github.com/g4klx), and the [OpenGD77 project from Roger Clark VK3KYY](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77).

I also have a few videos on my [YouTube channel] (https://www.youtube.com/@BudTalbot) related to amateur and wildland fire radio communication. 

I also have a few respositories related to my science education research. These are usually based around R code for network and regression analyses.
