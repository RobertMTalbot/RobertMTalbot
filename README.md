# Hey- I'm Bud!
_(Just like the cheap beer)_

## My job
I'm an associate professor of science education in the School of Education and Human Development at the University of Colorado Denver. I teach undergraduate pre-service science teachers, masters students (most of whom are practicing k-12 science teachers), and doctoral students. My research focuses on peer learning and teaching in undergraduate science courses. I am specifically interested in physics teaching and learning, but work across disciplines.

## My hobbies
I'm an amateur radio operator (US call: W0RMT; Australian call: VK3BUD) mostly interested in digital communications in the V/UHF parts of the spectrum. I operate D-STAR, DMR, YSF, NXDN, and P25. I build, maintain, and operate the [Colorado Digital multiprotocol system](https://coloradodigital.net).

## My projects
Most of my stuff on GitHub is focused on digital amateur radio projects like hotspots, pi-star, reflector lists, and the [OpenGD77 project](https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/OpenGD77).

I also have a few respositories related to my research. These are usually based around R code for network and regression analyses.
